# Overview

I have debugged the password generator web application to reflet the essential criteria:

I wanted to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security. 

# Essential Criteria 

I have applied the essential criteria as follows:

* When I click the button to generate a password I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* When prompted for password criteria I select which criteria to include in the password
* Then, when prompted for the length of the password I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* Then, asked for character types to include in the password
* Then,I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* When I answer each prompt, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* When the password is generated, then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Mock-Up
